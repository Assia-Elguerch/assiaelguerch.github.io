      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>
        I am very interested in computer science, particularly artificial intelligence and quantum computing. I took part in a variety of competitions and activities. I am interested in working on projects, being an entrepreneur, and making a difference in the lives of the next generation. I am a computer science and applied mathematics student who attended a P-TECH (IBM) supported school. And I'm on my way to realizing my ambition of becoming an AI and quantum computing researcher. I am also interested in Astrobiology.

          <p>
            P-TECH is a program sponsored by IBM that was launched in several high schools, and the only one Moroccan high school (Abderahman Ben Ghazala IT). I was a P-TECH student for three years in high school, and I learnt a lot of things. It was an incredible high school experience for me, and I had many opportunities, including meeting the vice president of IBM (Mrs. Justina Nixon Justina Saintil)

            I took part in the NASA Space Apps competition with a team of inter-earthlings. We were working on a project. It is about the Parker Solar Probe Challenge.
            I'd want to thank all of the organizers since they treated us like family and were so gracious. And I want to thank my teammates because they are the best, and I want them to know it. WE ARE WINNERS EVEN IF WE DO NOT WIN.
